# Binary_Classifier_Stock_Movements

This notebook presents a simple deep learning approach to predict movements of a stock. It is based on high-frequency limit order book data and information about former movements. 
Based on this and the order imbalance we build a fully-connected neural network to run a prediction on an unlabelled dataset.

For the implementation of the model we use the Keras library.
